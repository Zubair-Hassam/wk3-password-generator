# wk3-password-generator
This repo stores the homework for week 3 of the UWA course, which was a task of setting up a functioning password generator that was not correctly working. 

# Corrections made 
In ordet to get the generator to work, several additions had to be added to the main code in the script.js file. This consisted of additonal new variables to be introduced, creation of functions in order to determine lengths, uppercase variations as well as special charachter variations. 

# Criteria to be met
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
